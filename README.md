## Repaglinide-Model
Whole-body PBPK model of repaglinide as CYP2C8, CYP3A4, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 DDI victim drug

### Repository files
Within this repository, we distribute a whole-body PBPK model of repaglinide, that has been carefully developed using a large number of clinical studies and evaluated within our DDI modeling network. 

The PK-Sim project file contains simulations of all published clinical studies employed during model establishment, including the respective observed data digitized from literature reports. For further details, quantitative model evaluation, sensitivity analysis and extensive documentation please refer to [[1](#reference)].

### Version information
PK-Sim Version 7.3.0
